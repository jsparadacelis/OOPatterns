# OO Patterns

This repository has some examples about OO Patterns. I will try to cover a lot of them. The first one group are creational patterns like factories. If you want run these files you need take care about code in main fun at main file, because in that, I put all code as I built it. Per example, if you want to run factory method example, you need to comment Abstract factory section in main fun, an run:

```
go run main.go FactoryMethod.go
```

But, might you want to run complete example wrote in main fun. So you should write:

```
go run main.go FactoryMethod.go AbstractFactory.go
```
Is possible there is a simpler way to do that than before piece of shell commands... I'm just learning :D
